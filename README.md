===============================

This game uses javascript as its base code and HTML5 canvas to load 2d images. If you want to play the game you have to implement all the files in the repository, otherwise the game will break.

How To Play
===========

Use your keyboard arrow keys to move the boy character up down right left. In order to win the game you have to cross the road to the water without hitting with any bug. If you hit any bug your character will go back to the first block. If you get across to the water you will win the game and get a notification congratulating you.

Have Fun.
